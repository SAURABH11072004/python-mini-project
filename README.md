# Stock Volume Bar Chart Race

This project visualizes stock trading volumes over time using an animated bar chart race. The animation highlights the top 10 stocks with the highest trading volume at each time step, making it easier to observe the fluctuations in stock activity dynamically.

## Project Overview

In this project:

- We load CSV files containing stock trading data.
- The `bar_chart_race` library is used to create an animated video showing the trading volume as a "race" between the top stocks.
- The result is saved as `StockVolume_BarChartRace.mp4`.
- This video provides insights into how trading volume changes among different stocks over time.
